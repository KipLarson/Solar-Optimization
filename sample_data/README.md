# Sample Data Files

This directory contains sample CSV files for testing the Solar + Storage Optimization application.

## Files

### For Quick Testing (24 hours)
- `pv_production_sample.csv` - 24-hour PV production profile
- `pricing_sample.csv` - 24-hour pricing profile

**Note:** These are simplified 24-hour files. The optimization will work, but for realistic results, use the full-year files below.

### For Full Testing (8760 hours - Full Year)
- `pv_production_8760h.csv` - Full-year PV production profile
- `pricing_8760h.csv` - Full-year pricing profile

These files are located in `backend/test_data/` and can be generated by running:
```bash
cd backend/test_data
python generate_full_year_data.py
```

## File Formats

### PV Production CSV
```csv
Hour,Production_MWh_per_MW

```

- **Hour**: Hour of the year (1-8760)
- **Production_MWh_per_MW**: Production in MWh per MW of installed capacity

### Pricing CSV
